                <li>Noufel "INJECT31" Bouabdallah, also known as "Kimahak," is an Algerian underground techno music artist based in Spain. As a DJ, producer, and composer, Noufel has made significant strides in the electronic music world. His supportive father played a crucial role in nurturing his passion for music from the age of 8. At 16, Noufel began to explore tribal tech under the alias "NEEYO," performing in his local nightclub.</li>
                <li>His interest in the underground techno scene grew as he found inspiration from artists such as Luis Flores, Jeff Mills, Oscar Mulero, Reeko, and Speedy J. Noufel's background working in a plastic factory exposed him to industrial sounds, which influenced his sample creation and sound design. This experience led to the development of his first alias, "INJECT31," representing an injection of techno into Oran, his hometown (with the administrative circumscription number 31).</li>
                <li>Under the INJECT31 alias, Noufel has released music on renowned record labels worldwide, such as Traum TG, Vnderstand Recordings, and Apex Recordings, owned by legendary techno artist Henry Cullen (D.A.V.E The Drummer). His sound is characterized by industrial hard techno with a unique blend of Algerian samples.</li>
                <li>"Kimahak" is Noufel's most recent alias, showcasing his love for hypnotic and repetitive sounds. Under this name, he has released music on labels like Trau-ma (Robert Limited) and Lkemia (Algerian Techno Movement Sub-Label), where he experiments with techno and Intelligent Dance Music.</li>
